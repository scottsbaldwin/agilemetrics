Working Days:<br/>Enter the actual number of working days in the sprint. Use half-day increments. Do not include holidays or other significant time-off events for the entire team (a company or team party). Do not subtract for normal team meetings and other normal overhead.<br/><br/>Example: There are normally 10 days in a 2 week sprint, but team has 1 company holiday during that time and a 1/2 day department activity. You should enter 8.5 (10 - 1.5 = 8.5).
